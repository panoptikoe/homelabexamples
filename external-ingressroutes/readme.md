This folder contains examples of how you can use Traefik as a reverse proxy with external-ingressroutes to get HTTPS on Web UIs like HomeAssistant, Mikrotik or Proxmox. I'm pretty sure it can be done more efficiently or different, but this "works" so I just keep using these configurations.

They all utilise the `custom-middleware.yaml` file.
